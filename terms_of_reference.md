## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Title
**cleanepi-python: Clean and Standardize Epidemiological Data**

### 1.2 Project Purpose
The cleanepi-python project aims to develop a comprehensive, scalable Python package for cleaning, curating, and standardizing epidemiological data. This initiative represents a strategic port of the original R package [cleanepi](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cleanepi), enhanced with modern Python capabilities to support production environments, web applications, and large-scale data processing.

### 1.3 Background and Context
Epidemiological data often suffers from inconsistencies, missing values, duplicate records, and standardization issues that impede analysis and research. The original cleanepi R package addressed these challenges within the R ecosystem. The Python port extends this capability to Python-based workflows while adding enterprise-grade features such as web APIs, async processing, and enhanced security measures.

### 1.4 Alignment with Epiverse-TRACE Initiative
This project supports the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) mission to develop open-source software tools for outbreak analytics and epidemic preparedness, specifically addressing the need for robust data preprocessing capabilities in the Python ecosystem.
