## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
import pandas as pd
from cleanepi import clean_data, CleaningConfig

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("messy_data.csv")

# Configure cleaning
config = CleaningConfig(
    standardize_column_names=True,
    replace_missing_values=True,
    remove_duplicates=True,
    remove_constants=True
)

# Clean data
cleaned_data, report = clean_data(data, config)

# View results
print(report.summary())
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
from cleanepi.core.config import MissingValueConfig, DuplicateConfig

config = CleaningConfig(
    replace_missing_values=MissingValueConfig(
        na_strings=["-99", "unknown", "missing"],
        custom_na_by_column={
            "age": ["age unknown", "not recorded"],
            "test_result": ["pending", "cancelled"]
        }
    ),
    remove_duplicates=DuplicateConfig(
        target_columns=["patient_id", "visit_date"],
        keep="last"
    )
)
```

### Command-Line Usage
```bash
# Basic cleaning
cleanepi input.csv --standardize-columns --remove-duplicates

# Advanced cleaning with custom configuration
cleanepi input.csv --config config.json --output cleaned.csv --report report.json
```

### Web API Usage
```bash
# Start API server
python -m cleanepi.web.api

# Upload and clean data
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/clean" \
     -F "file=@data.csv" \
     -F "config_json={\"standardize_column_names\": true}"
